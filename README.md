## Highlights

- **One command installs agent skills from GitHub**: `agr add user/skill` — no manual file copying to `.claude/`
- **Try before you install**: `agrx user/skill` runs temporarily, then cleans up
- **Team reproducibility**: `agr.toml` tracks dependencies; `agr sync` installs everything
- **Auto-detects resource type**: Skills, commands, subagents — agr figures it out
- **Build your personal library**: Create a GitHub repo of your best skills and share them with anyone
- **Package related resources**: Package skills, commands, and subagents together for easy distribution
- **Stop editing `.claude/` directly**: Treat it like `.venv/` — let agr manage it, you manage source files

## Installation

No installation needed — run directly:

```bash
uvx agr add kasperjunge/hello-world
```

Or install permanently:

```bash
pip install agr
```

---

## Quick Start

### Install a resource

```bash
agr add kasperjunge/commit         # Semantic commit messages
agr add dsjacobsen/golang-pro      # Go development toolkit
```

Done. The resource is now available in Claude Code.

**Handle format:** `username/repo/resource` — if the repo is named `agent-resources`, omit it: `username/resource`

```bash
agr add alice/agent-resources/my-skill   # Full path
agr add alice/my-skill                   # Same thing (agent-resources is default)
agr add alice/my-repo/my-skill           # From a different repo
agr add alice/toolkit/nested/skill       # Nested resource: toolkit/nested/skill
```

### Try without installing

```bash
agrx kasperjunge/hello-world              # Runs and cleans up
agrx kasperjunge/hello-world "my prompt"  # With a prompt
agrx kasperjunge/hello-world -i           # Interactive mode
```

### Share with your team

```bash
# Your dependencies are tracked automatically
cat agr.toml
```

```toml
dependencies = [
    {handle = "kasperjunge/commit", type = "skill"},
    {handle = "dsjacobsen/golang-pro", type = "skill"},
]
```

```bash
# Teammates run one command
agr sync
