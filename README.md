> **Note:** Support for rules, subagents, and slash commands has been removed. Most AI coding agents are converging on skills as the standard format, so agr now focuses exclusively on skills. To convert your existing rules, commands, or subagents to skills, run:
> ```bash
> agrx kasperjunge/migrate-to-skills
> agrx kasperjunge/migrate-to-skills -p "convert files in ./my-commands"
> ```

---

## Getting Started

Install agr CLI:

```bash
pip install agr
```

Install your first skill:

```bash
agr add anthropics/skills/frontend-design
```

That's it. The skill is now available in your configured tool (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, or Copilot).

---

## What is agr?

**agr** installs agent skills from GitHub directly into your tool's skills folder
(`.claude/skills/`, `.codex/skills/`, `.cursor/skills/`, or `.github/skills/`).

**agrx** runs skills instantly from your terminal — one command, no setup.

---

## Install Skills

```bash
agr add anthropics/skills/frontend-design     # Install a skill
agr add anthropics/skills/pdf anthropics/skills/mcp-builder   # Install multiple
agr add anthropics/skills/pdf --source github # Install from an explicit source
```

### Handle format

```
username/skill-name         → From user's agent-resources repo
username/repo/skill-name    → From a specific repo
./path/to/skill             → From local directory
```

---

## Run Skills From Your Terminal

```bash
agrx anthropics/skills/pdf                              # Run a skill instantly
agrx anthropics/skills/pdf -p "Extract tables from report.pdf"   # With a prompt
agrx anthropics/skills/skill-creator -i                 # Run, then continue chatting
agrx anthropics/skills/pdf --source github              # Explicit source
```

---

## Team Sync

Your dependencies are tracked in `agr.toml`:

```toml
default_source = "github"

dependencies = [
    {handle = "anthropics/skills/frontend-design", type = "skill"},
    {handle = "anthropics/skills/brand-guidelines", type = "skill"},
]

[[source]]
name = "github"
type = "git"
url = "https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}.git"
```

Note: `dependencies` must appear before any `[[source]]` blocks in `agr.toml`.

Teammates run:

```bash
agr sync
```

---

## Create Your Own Skill

```bash
agr init my-skill
```

Creates `my-skill/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does.
---

# My Skill

Instructions for the agent.
```

Test it locally:

```bash
agr add ./my-skill
```

Share it:

```bash
# Push to GitHub, then others can:
agr add your-username/my-skill
```
