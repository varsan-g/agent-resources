# AGR — Skills for AI Agents

A package and project manager for AI agent skills. Install, share, and manage skills from GitHub.

!!! note "Migrating from rules, subagents, or slash commands?"
    Support for rules, subagents, and slash commands has been removed. Most AI coding agents are converging on skills as the standard format, so agr now focuses exclusively on skills. To convert your existing files to skills, run:

    ```bash
    agrx kasperjunge/migrate-to-skills
    agrx kasperjunge/migrate-to-skills -p "convert files in ./my-commands"
    ```

## Install

```bash
pip install agr
```

## Add a Skill

```bash
agr add anthropics/skills/frontend-design
```

Done. The skill is available in your configured tool (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, or Copilot).

## Run a Skill Directly

Run skills from your terminal without installing:

```bash
agrx anthropics/skills/pdf                  # Run once, then clean up
agrx anthropics/skills/pdf -p "Extract tables from report.pdf"
agrx anthropics/skills/pdf -i               # Interactive: run skill, then continue chatting
```

The `-i` flag runs the skill first, then starts an interactive session so you can continue the conversation.

## Share with Your Team

Dependencies are tracked in `agr.toml`:

```toml
default_source = "github"

dependencies = [
    {handle = "anthropics/skills/frontend-design"},
    {handle = "anthropics/skills/skill-creator"},
]

[[source]]
name = "github"
type = "git"
url = "https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}.git"
```

Teammates install everything with:

```bash
agr sync
```

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `agr add <handle>` | Install a skill |
| `agr remove <handle>` | Uninstall a skill |
| `agr sync` | Install all dependencies from `agr.toml` |
| `agr list` | Show skills and installation status |
| `agr init` | Create `agr.toml` |
| `agr init <name>` | Create a skill scaffold |
| `agrx <handle>` | Run a skill temporarily |

## Handle Format

```bash
agr add user/skill              # From user's "agent-resources" repo
agr add user/repo/skill         # From a different repo
```

If a user's repo is named `agent-resources`, you can skip the repo name:

```bash
agr add kasperjunge/commit                    # From kasperjunge/agent-resources
agr add kasperjunge/agent-resources/commit    # Same thing (explicit)
```

## Skill Discovery

When you run `agr add user/repo/skill`, agr automatically searches the repo for a skill named `skill`. It doesn't matter where the skill is located—it will be found if it exists anywhere in:

- `resources/skills/{skill}/SKILL.md`
- `skills/{skill}/SKILL.md`
- `{skill}/SKILL.md`

If two skills have the same name, you'll get an error.

## Example Skills

```bash
agr add anthropics/skills/frontend-design    # Build production-grade UIs
agr add anthropics/skills/skill-creator      # Create new skills
agr add anthropics/skills/pdf                # Work with PDF documents
```
