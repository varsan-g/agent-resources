# Product Strategy Skills

A repeatable product strategy workflow aligned to Opportunity Solution Trees (OST). Each step is a skill you can invoke, so it is easy to run the full strategy loop on a real product question.

## The Workflow

### 1. `/discover-outcomes` — Define success first
**Purpose:** Turn goals into measurable outcomes before discussing ideas.
**Key principle:** Outcomes are behavior change, not features.
**Use when:** You need a clear target and success metrics.
**Output:** Outcome ladder with baselines, targets, and time windows.

### 2. `/discover-opportunities` — Find the right problems
**Purpose:** Identify JTBD opportunities grounded in real user frictions.
**Key principle:** No solutions until opportunities are clear.
**Use when:** Outcomes are defined and you need strong opportunity candidates.
**Output:** Ranked opportunity statements with evidence and gaps.

### 3. `/ideate-solutions` — Explore solution concepts
**Purpose:** Generate multiple solution concepts tied to outcomes and opportunities.
**Key principle:** Diverge before you converge.
**Use when:** You need 3-5 distinct ways to address top opportunities.
**Output:** Concept set with pros/cons, feasibility, and differentiation.

### 4. `/discover-assumptions` — De-risk with experiments
**Purpose:** Surface riskiest assumptions and design fast validation tests.
**Key principle:** Validate the riskiest assumptions first.
**Use when:** You have leading solution concepts and need evidence.
**Output:** Prioritized assumptions and sequenced experiment plan.

## Why It Works

- **Start with outcomes.** You cannot pick good opportunities without a clear target.
- **Ground opportunities in JTBD.** This keeps strategy anchored in real user value.
- **Generate multiple solutions.** Avoid overcommitting to the first idea.
- **Validate before building.** Experiments save time and prevent costly bets.

## Quick Start

Pick a product goal and run `/discover-outcomes`. Each skill will point to the next step.
