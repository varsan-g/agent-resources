# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Config now saved after sync completes in `agr tools add`, preventing data inconsistency if sync fails
- Tool not removed from config if skill deletion fails in `agr tools remove`, preventing orphaned files
- Use `DEFAULT_TOOL_NAMES[0]` constant instead of hardcoded "claude" in agrx fallback
- Add type annotation to `_check_tool_cli()` in agrx
- Remove dead code (unused variable assignment) in agrx

## [0.7.1b1] - 2026-01-27

### Added
- GitHub Copilot support with flat directory structure (`.github/skills/` for project, `~/.copilot/skills/` for global)
- `global_config_dir` field in `ToolConfig` for tools where personal path differs from project path
- Private repository support via GITHUB_TOKEN/GH_TOKEN environment variables
- `AuthenticationError` exception for authentication failures (401/403 responses)
- Comprehensive test coverage for GitHub authentication and error handling
- CLI integration tests for Cursor tool support (`test_cursor.py`)
- CLI integration tests for GitHub Copilot tool support (`test_copilot.py`)
- CLI integration tests for private repo authentication (`test_private_repo.py`)
- Tests for multi-tool scenarios (Claude + Cursor, Claude + Copilot)
- Token security tests ensuring credentials are not leaked in error messages

## [0.7.0] - 2026-01-27

### Added
- `@pytest.mark.requires_cli(name)` marker to skip tests when required CLI tools aren't installed
- **Multi-tool support**: Skills can now be installed to multiple AI coding tools simultaneously
- CLI testing infrastructure with fluent assertion API (`assert_cli(result).succeeded().stdout_contains("...")`)
- Test coverage for `agr add`, `remove`, `init`, `sync`, `list`, `--version`, `--help`
- Test coverage for `agrx` command with network marker for external dependency tests
- Edge case tests: adding already-installed skill, removing non-installed skill, init with existing directory
- Negative assertion helpers: `stdout_not_contains()`, `stderr_not_contains()`
- `@pytest.mark.network` marker for tests requiring network access (skip with `-m "not network"`)
- Cursor tool configuration with nested directory structure (e.g., `.cursor/skills/username/skill/`)
- `tools` configuration in `agr.toml` to specify target tools: `tools = ["claude", "cursor"]`
- `fetch_and_install_to_tools()` function for atomic multi-tool installation with rollback
- Validation that empty tools list raises `ValueError` in `fetch_and_install_to_tools`
- Type hints to `_get_installation_status` in list command

### Changed
- Reorganized `.gitignore` to group tool directories (`.claude/`, `.cursor/`) at top
- `ParsedHandle` now generates tool-appropriate paths (flat for Claude, nested for Cursor)
- Commands (`add`, `remove`, `list`, `sync`) now operate on all configured tools
- Rollback failures in `fetch_and_install_to_tools` now log warnings instead of being silently ignored
- Extracted common installation logic into `_copy_skill_to_destination` helper (DRY refactor)
- Tool names in `agr.toml` are now validated at config load time, catching typos early
- Error messages in `agr remove` now distinguish between "not found" and actual errors
- Release workflow now extracts notes from CHANGELOG.md instead of requiring RELEASE_NOTES.md
- Workflow checkouts the tag directly (fixes race condition with main branch)
- Only release job has contents:write permission (security improvement)
- Added tag format validation in workflow
- Updated /make-release skill to match new automated workflow (6 steps instead of 8)

### Fixed
- Fix import order in `fetcher.py` to resolve E402 linting errors
- Use `SKILL_MARKER` constant instead of hardcoded `"SKILL.md"` string in sync command
- Shell injection risk in workflow by using environment variables instead of direct interpolation
- Hardcoded repository URL in release notes now uses GitHub context variables

## [0.6.4] - 2026-01-27

### Fixed
- Fix CI/CD publish workflow to use virtualenv instead of system Python

## [0.6.3] - 2026-01-27

### Fixed
- Added dev dependencies (ruff, pytest) to pyproject.toml for CI/CD
- Fixed linting and formatting issues for ruff compatibility

## [0.6.2] - 2026-01-27

### Changed
- Use `--` separator instead of `:` for installed skill directory names (Windows compatibility)
- Installed names now use format `username--skill` instead of `username:skill`
- Local skills use `local--skillname` instead of `local:skillname`

### Added
- Development workflow skills: `/research`, `/discover-solution-space`, `/make-plan`, `/code-review`, `/make-commit`, `/make-release`
- Skills implement a structured feature development cycle: research → solution exploration → planning → code review → commit → release
- Automatic migration of legacy colon-based directories during `agr sync`
- Validation to reject handles containing reserved `--` sequence
- Backward compatibility for parsing legacy colon-format installed names
- Comprehensive tests for separator migration and validation
- GitHub Actions workflow for automated PyPI publishing via trusted publishing (OIDC)
