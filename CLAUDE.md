# Agent Resources

A package manager for AI agents. 

## Commands

This project uses `uv` for Python environment management. **Always use `uv run` to execute Python commands** to ensure they run in the correct virtual environment.

```bash
# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Run linters/formatters
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format .

# Run type checker
uv run ty check

# Test the CLI tools
uv run agr --help
uv run agrx --help
```

## Architecture
...

## agr.toml Format

The configuration file uses a flat array of dependencies:

```toml
dependencies = [
    {handle = "username/repo/skill", type = "skill"},
    {handle = "username/skill", type = "skill"},
    {path = "./local/skill", type = "skill"},
]
```

Each dependency has:
- `type`: Always "skill" for now
- `handle`: Remote GitHub reference (username/repo/skill or username/skill)
- `path`: Local path (alternative to handle)

Future: A `tools` section will configure which tools to sync to:
```toml
tools = ["claude", "cursor"]
```

## Boundaries

### Always Do
- agr and agrx should always be unified and synced.
- include in the plan to write tests for what is implemented
- Save all skills in `skills/` directory (not `.claude/skills/` which is gitignored)

### Ask First
...

### Never Do
